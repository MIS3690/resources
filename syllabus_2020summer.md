## Private Repository for the Course

Your first task in this course is to create your web page for this course. This will be very simple and clean to start with. We will make this more sophisticated as we get deeper into the course and we will link all of the deliverables for the course to this page. This will create your personal web site (private repository). The most important purpose for this web site is to **list and link** all of your class deliverables - in-class deliverables, graded homework, term project and exam (only if specified) - after you commit and push to your private repository. It is critical that you keep this repository updated. The graded work for the class will be graded off of this web page (in other words, I will be accessing your graded homework/exam through the link you have created on this web site).

## Project

The term project is an individual website development effort, which involves the conception, design and implementation of a website. You must publish your site to an advertising-free hosting service. ~~These will typically cost you a hosting service fee and a domain registration fee, totaling about \$20-40. _You will be responsible for paying this fee separate from the tuition charges during the term, as indicated in the course catalog._~~ We may use free cloud service to host your website. Deliverables are due periodically during the semester, shown in the course schedule. Although we will not have any class presentations of projects, the instructor may ask specific students to present projects based on value it might add to the class. More details will be posted soon.

## Graded Homework

There will be a total of 5-6 homework-assignments that are graded. Each is to be submitted by 11:59 pm on the due dates, which will be specified in the instruction document that accompanies each assignment. Five points will be deducted for each day or partial day that an assignment is late up to four days. The grade for any assignment submitted more than four days late will be zero. Extensions may be granted at the discretion of the instructor if requested in advance. Assignments are considered to be **individual** activities. If you require help, please contact the instructor.

## In-Class Exercises

In almost every class we will be completing a few small hands-on exercises (usually labeled as “ex_” on the class slides). Some of you may complete these exercises in class, but, you do have until 11:59 pm the next calendar day (not the next class day) to complete it and sync it. Class Exercises will be graded as Submitted, Excused, or Not Submitted. If you miss a class, you will still need to finish the in-class exercise. There will be about 16 to 20 exercises in total - two excuses are allowed for the semester, with additional excuses at the discretion of the instructor.

## Examination

There will be one exam in the second week of November. The exam is in-class, hands-on, open book, open notes, open web exam. The exam will be about 100 minutes long. The exam will be based largely on the graded homework and in-class exercises done. Unexcused absence will result in a score of zero for the exam. Kindly make alternate arrangements if you believe you have a conflict after checking the course schedule below.
